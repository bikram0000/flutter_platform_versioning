Flutter Platform Versioning is a command-line tool to set different versions for different platforms in a Flutter project.

## Installation

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file under `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_platform_versioning: ^1.0.0
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

To use Flutter Platform Versioning, run the following command in the root of your Flutter project:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_platform_versioning:fpv
```

This will display the help and available options.

## Options

- `--init`: Initialize Flutter Platform Versioning (creates if not there flutter_platform_versioning.yaml).
- `--update`: Update all platform versions.
- `--remove`: Remove Flutter Platform Versioning (deletes flutter_platform_versioning.yaml) and replace with pubspec.yaml version.
- `--all`: Set version for all platforms.
- `-p, --path`: Specify the path for the config file.
- `-a, --android`: Set the Flutter Android version.
- `-i, --ios`: Set the Flutter iOS version.
- `-m, --macos`: Set the Flutter macOS version.
- `-w, --windows`: Set the Flutter Windows version.
- `-h, --help`: Prints out available command usages.

## Examples

Initialize Flutter Platform Versioning:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_platform_versioning:fpv --init
```

Update all platform versions:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_platform_versioning:fpv --update
```

Remove Flutter Platform Versioning and replace with pubspec.yaml version:

flutter pub run flutter_platform_versioning:fpv --remove
